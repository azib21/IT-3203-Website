        countries and inspired millions worldwide.
      </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pelé (Brazil):</strong> Pelé is regarded by many people as the best player of all time. He is the only player 
        to win three World Cups (1958, 1962, 1970) and became a world known symbol of Brazilian football.
      </li>

      <li><strong>Diego Maradona (Argentina):</strong> Known for flair and creativity, he led Argentina to World Cup victory
        in 1986. He is remembered for his controversial "Hand of God" and "Goal of the Century" in the same tournament. 
      </li>

      <li><strong>Lionel Messi (Argentina):</strong> Messi led Argentina to victory in 2022 after many years in his career chasing the trophy.
        Widely considered the greatest of all time, his performance in the Qatar 2022 World Cup completed one of the most successful
        careers ever in soccer history.
