      <h2>Key Concepts to Understand the World Cup</h2>
      <p>
        To really follow the FIFA World Cup, it helps to understand some common soccer terms that
        commentators, players, and fans use all the time. The concepts below show up again and again
        during important moments in matches and are closely connected to what you saw on the
        <a href="history.html">History</a> and <a href="players.html">Players &amp; Teams</a> pages.

      <!-- Key concepts list -->
      <ol class="concept-list">
        <li>
          <strong>FIFA:</strong> The global governing body of soccer that organizes the World Cup and
          sets the rules of the game. FIFA also decides which countries will host each tournament.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>VAR (Video Assistant Referee):</strong> A system that allows referees to review
          important plays using video replays. VAR is used for situations like penalties, red cards,
          and offside goals to help reduce major mistakes.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Offside Rule:</strong> A rule that prevents attackers from standing too close to
          the opponent's goal waiting for an easy pass. A player is offside if they are nearer to
          the opponent's goal than both the ball and the second-to-last defender when the ball is
          played to them.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Group Stage:</strong> The first round of the World Cup, where teams are divided
          into groups. Each team plays several matches, and they earn points for wins and draws.
          The top teams in each group move on to the knockout stage.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Knockout Stage:</strong> The second part of the tournament where matches are
          single elimination. If you lose, you are out. This stage includes the round of 16,
          quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Penalty Shootout:</strong> A way to decide a winner when a knockout match is still
          tied after extra time. Each team takes turns shooting from the penalty spot, and the team
          with more goals after a set number of kicks wins the match.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Golden Boot:</strong> The award given to the player who scores the most goals in
          a World Cup tournament. Famous winners include Ronaldo (Brazil), Miroslav Klose (Germany),
          and Kylian Mbappé (France).
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Hat-trick:</strong> When a single player scores three goals in one match. Scoring
          a hat-trick in a World Cup game is rare and usually becomes a key part of that player's
          legacy.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Extra Time:</strong> An additional 30 minutes of play (two 15-minute halves)
          added when a knockout match is tied after 90 minutes. If the game is still tied after
          extra time, it usually goes to a penalty shootout.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Clean Sheet:</strong> When a team does not concede any goals in a match. Goalkeepers
          and defenders are often praised for keeping a clean sheet, especially in high-pressure
          World Cup games.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2 class="concept-section-alt">Why These Concepts Matter During the World Cup</h2>
      <p>
        These concepts shape how games are played and remembered. Here are a few ways they show up during the tournament:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>VAR and the Offside Rule</strong> can completely change the result of a match by
          canceling or confirming key goals, especially in the knockout rounds.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Group Stage and Knockout Stage</strong> decide how far a country goes in the
          tournament and who they play next.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Penalty Shootouts</strong> often become some of the most unforgettable moments in
          World Cup history, as entire nations watch one player take a single, high-pressure shot.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Golden Boot and Hat-tricks</strong> help define the legacy of star players like
          Pelé, Maradona, and Messi, who you learned about on the
          <a href="players.html">Players &amp; Teams</a> page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clean Sheets and strong defenses</strong> are just as important as goal scoring,
          especially in tight matches where one mistake can end a team's World Cup journey.
        </li>
      </ul>
